## Introduction

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/framework_surveyforge.png" width="99%">
  <!-- <div>The overview of SURVEYFORGE. The framework consists of two main stages: Outline Generation and Content Writing. In the Outline Generation stage, SURVEYFORGE utilizes heuristic learning to generate well-structured outlines by leveraging topic-relevant literature and structural patterns from existing surveys. In the Content Writing stage, a memory-driven Scholar Navigation Agent (SANA) retrieves high-quality literature for each subsection and LLM generates the content of each subsection. Finally, the content is synthesized and refined into a coherent and comprehensive survey.

Survey papers are vital in scientific research, especially with the rapid increase in research publications. Recently, researchers have started using LLMs to automate survey creation for improved efficiency. However, LLM-generated surveys often fall short compared to human-written ones, particularly in outline quality and citation accuracy. To address this, we introduce **SurveyForge**, which first creates an outline by analyzing the structure of human-written outlines and consulting domain-related articles. Then, using high-quality papers retrieved by our scholar navigation agent, **SurveyForge** can automatically generate and refine the content of the survey.

Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct **SurveyBench**, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality.

## ü§îHow to try out SurveyForge?

Due to the current limitations on API call frequency, **please kindly send us an email or open an issue** in the repository to inform us of the **survey topic** you intend to generate.

‚è±Ô∏èSurveyforge only takes about **10 minutes** to generate a survey paper. There may be a wait time as the number of users increases, so submit your topic early!

üåüDon‚Äôt forget to click the STAR to track if your survey is ready!

At this stage, this is the best way for us to showcase the capabilities of SurveyForge. Moving forward, we are actively working to enhance our API capacity and aim to make SurveyForge publicly accessible in the near future. Thank you for your understanding and support!
