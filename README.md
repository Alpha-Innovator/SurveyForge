## Introduction

  <!-- <div>The overview of SURVEYFORGE. The framework consists of two main stages: Outline Generation and Content Writing. In the Outline Generation stage, SURVEYFORGE utilizes heuristic learning to generate well-structured outlines by leveraging topic-relevant literature and structural patterns from existing surveys. In the Content Writing stage, a memory-driven Scholar Navigation Agent (SANA) retrieves high-quality literature for each subsection and LLM generates the content of each subsection. Finally, the content is synthesized and refined into a coherent and comprehensive survey.
</div> -->
</p>

Survey papers are vital in scientific research, especially with the rapid increase in research publications. Recently, researchers have started using LLMs to automate survey creation for improved efficiency. However, LLM-generated surveys often fall short compared to human-written ones, particularly in outline quality and citation accuracy. To address this, we introduce **SurveyForge**, which first creates an outline by analyzing the structure of human-written outlines and consulting domain-related articles. Then, using high-quality papers retrieved by our scholar navigation agent, **SurveyForge** can automatically generate and refine the content of the survey.

Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct **SurveyBench**, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality.

## ü§îHow to try out SurveyForge?
- First you need to download the database from [[SurveyForge Database]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/U4R/SurveyForge_database/tree/main).



- Then you need to download the embedding model from [[gte-large-en-v1.5]](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5/tree/main)



- Finally, configure your **API KEY** and **data path** in [code/run_demo.py](./code/run_demo.py) and run the command as follows:


```
cd code && python run_demo.py
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to evaluate the quality of the survey paper?

We offer **SurveyBench**, a benchmark for **academic research** and **evaluating the quality of AI-generated surveys.**

[SurveyBench Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/U4R/SurveyBench)

Currently , SurveyBench consists of approximately 100 human-written survey papers across 10 distinct topics, carefully curated by doctoral-level researchers to ensure thematic consistency and academic rigor. The supported topics and the core references corresponding to each topic are as follows:

More support topics coming soon!

### üßë‚ÄçüíªYou can evaluate the survey by:

```
cd SurveyBench && python test.py --is_human_eval
```

Note set `is_human_eval` True for human survey evaluation, False for generated surveys.

If you want to evaluate your method on SurveyBench, please follow the format:

```
generated_surveys
|-- 3D Gaussian Splatting
    |-- exp_1
        |-- ref.json
    |-- exp_2
        |-- ref.json
...
|-- Graph Neural Networks
...
```
